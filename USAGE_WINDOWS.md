## Necessary for working
I made minor changes to the code to ensure that it runs on windows.
So make sure to be on a branch build up on the branch named windows.
For the NVIDIA RTX 3090 cuda 11 instead of 10 need to be installed.

## Try this if it still not works
Install mpi4py with pip and not conda.

If you need to download the pretrained jukebox, make sure 
[wget is installed](https://builtvisible.com/download-your-website-with-wget/).

Not sure if necessary, but maybe MPI needs to be set in the path environment variable.
